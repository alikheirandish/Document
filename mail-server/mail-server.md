# Mail Server

In general, all email servers consists of three main components: MTA, MDA & MUA.

## Mail Transport Agent(MTA)

A Mail Transport Agent (MTA) transports email messages between hosts using SMTP. A message may involve several MTAs as it moves to its intended destination.

## Mail Delivery Agent(MDA)

A Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) is invoked by the MTA to file incoming emails in the proper userâ€™s mailbox. In many cases, the MDA is actually a Local Delivery Agent (LDA), such as mail or Procmail.

## Mail User Agent(MUA)

A Mail User Agent (MUA) is synonymous with an email client application. An MUA is a program that, at a minimum, allows a user to read and compose email messages. Many MUAs are capable of retrieving messages via the POP or IMAPprotocols, setting up mailboxes to store messages, and sending outbound messages to an MTA.
